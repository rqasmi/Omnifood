# Omnifood website
This repository contains a virtual food delivery service webpage built using HTML5, CSS3 and jQuery library. Animations were implemented
with the waypoints jQuery plugin. 

## Fluid grid
A fluid grid was setup using the grid.css file downloaded from the responsive grid system website.

## Mobile Responsiveness
The quereies.css file enables the website to be mobile responsive. Four width limits (in pixels) were defined 
in the media queries based on the different standard screen sizes (1140px , 1024px, 768px, 480px).
